# **Civil Legal Advice using Playwright, Behave and Python**

This is an example project demonstrating how I approached writing an e2e test scenario using behave, playwright and python. 
The current project is from a larger project that I completed for civil legal aid eligibility at the Ministry of Justice. 
The intention for this project is to provoke discussion with other developers and potential employers.
